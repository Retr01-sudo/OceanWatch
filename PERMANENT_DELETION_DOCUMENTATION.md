# OceanWatch Permanent Deletion System

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive permanent deletion system implemented for OceanWatch to ensure reports are completely removed from all data stores and do not reappear after page refresh.

## 🎯 Problem Solved
**Issue**: Reports were being removed from the dashboard UI but reappearing after page refresh because the backend cleanup was incomplete and failed silently on missing tables.

**Solution**: Implemented a robust, comprehensive deletion system that:
- Permanently removes reports from all relevant data stores
- Handles missing optional tables gracefully with proper logging
- Refreshes frontend data from server after deletion
- Updates map markers in real-time
- Provides detailed audit logging

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend Deletion Service
**File**: `/packages/backend-api/src/services/deletionService.js`

The `DeletionService` class provides comprehensive deletion functionality:

#### Core Methods
- `deleteReportCompletely(reportId, adminUserId)` - Single report deletion
- `bulkDeleteReports(reportIds, adminUserId)` - Multiple report deletion
- `deleteFromAllRelatedTables(client, reportId)` - Safe table cleanup
- `deleteAssociatedFiles(report)` - File system cleanup
- `logDeletionAction(client, reportId, report, adminUserId, deletionResults)` - Audit logging

#### Tables Handled
The system attempts to clean up data from the following tables:
1. **reports** (mandatory) - Main report data
2. **map_markers** - Map marker positions
3. **analytics_daily** - Daily analytics data
4. **analytics** - General analytics data
5. **metrics_cache** - Cached metrics
6. **activity_logs** - Activity log entries
7. **report_analytics** - Report-specific analytics
8. **report_metrics** - Report metrics data

#### Safe Error Handling
- Checks table existence before attempting deletion
- Logs warnings for missing tables but continues processing
- Never fails silently - all operations are logged
- Uses database transactions for atomicity

### Frontend Integration
**Files**: 
- `/packages/web-app/src/contexts/ReportsContext.tsx`
- `/packages/web-app/src/components/MapView.tsx`

#### Real-time Updates
- `deleteReportFromServer()` refreshes reports list from server after deletion
- `bulkDeleteReports()` refreshes reports list from server after bulk deletion
- Map markers automatically update when reports list changes
- No local state manipulation - always fetch fresh data from server

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Database Transaction Flow
```javascript
// 1. Start transaction
await client.query('BEGIN');

// 2. Get report details for file cleanup
const report = await client.query('SELECT * FROM reports WHERE id = $1', [reportId]);

// 3. Delete associated files from filesystem
await deleteAssociatedFiles(report);

// 4. Delete from all related tables safely
const deletionResults = await deleteFromAllRelatedTables(client, reportId);

// 5. Delete main report record
await client.query('DELETE FROM reports WHERE id = $1', [reportId]);

// 6. Log deletion action for audit
await logDeletionAction(client, reportId, report, adminUserId, deletionResults);

// 7. Commit transaction
await client.query('COMMIT');
```

### Safe Table Cleanup Process
```javascript
// For each related table:
// 1. Check if table exists
const tableExists = await client.query(`
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
    WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = $1
  )
`, [tableName]);

// 2. If exists, delete related records
if (tableExists.rows[0].exists) {
  const result = await client.query('DELETE FROM table WHERE report_id = $1', [reportId]);
  // Log success
} else {
  // Log table missing, continue processing
}
```

### Comprehensive Logging
All deletion operations are logged with:
- Report ID and original user ID
- Admin user who performed deletion
- Timestamp of deletion
- File cleanup results
- Table-by-table deletion results
- Error details for any failures

## 📊 Testing Results

The comprehensive test suite (`/packages/backend-api/tests/deletion-test.js`) validates:

✅ **Test 1**: Test data creation  
✅ **Test 2**: Single report deletion  
✅ **Test 3**: Bulk deletion  
✅ **Test 4**: Missing tables handling  
✅ **Test 5**: Deletion logging  

**All 5 tests passed** - Deletion functionality is working correctly.

### Test Output Summary
```
Tables processed: 2 (map_markers, analytics_daily)
Tables skipped: 5 (analytics, metrics_cache, activity_logs, report_analytics, report_metrics)
Errors: 0
Total rows deleted: 0 (no related data existed)
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Single Report Deletion
```javascript
// Backend API endpoint
DELETE /api/reports/:id

// Frontend usage
await deleteReportFromServer(reportId);
```

### Bulk Report Deletion
```javascript
// Backend API endpoint
POST /api/reports/bulk-delete
Body: { reportIds: [1, 2, 3] }

// Frontend usage
await bulkDeleteReports([1, 2, 3]);
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Deletion Logs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE deletion_logs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  report_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  original_user_id INTEGER,
  deleted_by_admin_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  event_type VARCHAR(100),
  deletion_reason TEXT,
  original_created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  metadata JSONB
);
```

### Log Analysis
Query deletion logs to monitor system health:
```sql
-- Recent deletions
SELECT * FROM deletion_logs ORDER BY deleted_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Deletion statistics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_deletions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT deleted_by_admin_id) as admin_count,
  DATE_TRUNC('day', deleted_at) as deletion_date
FROM deletion_logs 
WHERE deleted_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', deleted_at);
```

## 🛡️ Security & Safety

### Access Control
- Deletion endpoints require admin authentication
- All deletions are logged with admin user ID
- Bulk deletion validates all report IDs

### Data Safety
- Database transactions ensure atomicity
- File cleanup is safe (checks existence before deletion)
- Missing tables don't cause failures
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

### Audit Trail
- Complete deletion history in `deletion_logs` table
- Metadata includes table-by-table results
- Original report details preserved for audit

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Soft Delete Option**: Add ability to mark reports as deleted instead of permanent removal
2. **Deletion Scheduling**: Allow scheduled deletion of old reports
3. **Recovery System**: Implement report recovery from deletion logs
4. **Performance Optimization**: Batch operations for large-scale deletions
5. **Notification System**: Alert admins of bulk deletion operations

### Monitoring Enhancements
1. **Dashboard Metrics**: Add deletion statistics to admin dashboard
2. **Alert System**: Notify on unusual deletion patterns
3. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor deletion operation times
4. **Storage Cleanup**: Automated cleanup of orphaned files
